				<br><br>
				A reading from the book of Ecclesiastes
				<br><br>
				There is an appointed time for everything,<br>
				and a time for every affair under the heavens.<br><br>
				A time to give birth, and a time to die;<br>
				a time to plant, and a time to uproot the plant.<br><br>
				A time to kill, and a time to heal;<br>
				a time to tear down, and a time to build.<br><br>
				A time to weep, and a time to laugh;<br>
				a time to mourn, and a time to dance.<br><br>

				What profit have workers from their toil?<br><br>
				I have seen the business that God has given to mortals to be busied about.<br><br>
				God has made everything appropriate to its time, but has put the timeless into their hearts so
				they cannot find out, from beginning to end, the work which God has done.<br><br>
				I recognized that there is nothing better than to rejoice and to do well during life.<br><br>
				Moreover, that all can eat and drink and enjoy the good of all their toil—this is a gift of
				God.<br><br>
				I recognized that whatever God does will endure forever; there is no adding to it, or taking
				from it. Thus has God done that he may be revered.<br><br>
				What now is has already been; what is to be, already is: God retrieves what has gone by.<br><br>
				The word of the Lord.

				<br><br>
				A reading from the book of the prophet Proverbs
				<br><br>
				When one finds a worthy wife, her value is far beyond pearls. Her husband, entrusting his heart
				to her, has an unfailing prize. She brings him good, and not evil, all the days of her life. She
				rises while it is still night, and distributes food to her household.<br><br>
				She enjoys the success of her dealings; at night her lamp is undimmed. She fears not the snow
				for her household; all her charges are doubly clothed.<br>
				<br>She is clothed in strength and dignity, and she laughs at the days to come. <br>
				She opens her mouth in wisdom, and on her tongue is kindly counsel. She watches the conduct of
				her household, and eats not her food in idleness. Her children rise up and praise her; her
				husband, too, extols her.<br><br>
				Many are the women of proven worth, but you have excelled them all. Charm is deceptive and
				beauty fleeting; the woman who fears the Lord is to be praised. Give her a reward of her labors,
				and let her works praise her at the city gates.

				<br><br>
				A reading from the book of Revelation
				<br><br>
				I saw a large white throne and the one who was sitting on it.
				The earth and the sky fled from his presence and there was no
				place for them. <br><br>I saw the dead, the great and the lowly, standing
				before the throne, and scrolls were opened. Then another
				scroll was opened, the book of life. <br><br> The dead were judged
				according to their deeds, by what was written in the scrolls. The
				sea gave up its dead; then Death and Hades gave up their dead.
				All the dead were judged according to their deeds. <br><br> Then
				Death and Hades were thrown into the pool of fire. (This pool
				of fire is the second death.) Anyone whose name was not
				found written in the book of life was thrown into the pool of fire.<br><br>
				Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth. The former heaven
				and the former earth had passed away, and the sea was no
				more.

				A reading from the book of Revelation
				<br><br>
				I saw a new heaven and a new earth. <br>The former heaven and the former earth had passed away,
				and the sea no more. <br><br>I also saw the holy city, a new Jerusalem, coming down out of
				heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. <br><br>I heard a loud voice from
				the throne saying, <br>“Behold, God’s dwelling is with the human race. <br> He will dwell with
				them and they will be his people, and God himself will always be with them as their God. <br>He
				will wipe every tear from their eyes, and there shall be no more death or mourning, wailing or
				pain, for the old order has passed away.” <br><br>
				The One who sat on the throne said, <br>“Behold, I make all things new! <br>I am the Alpha and
				the Omega, the beginning and the end. <br>To the thirsty I will give a gift from the spring of
				life-giving water.<br> The victor will inherit these gifts, and I shall be his God and he will
				be my son.”

				A reading from the first Letter of Saint Paul to the Thessalonians
				<br><br>
				We do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters,<br>
				about those who have fallen asleep so that you may not grieve<br>
				like the rest, who have no hope.<br><br>
				For if we believe that Jesus died and rose, so too will God, through Jesus, <br>
				bring with him those who have fallen asleep.<br><br>
				Indeed, we tell you this, on the word of the Lord, that we <br>
				who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord,<br>
				will surely not precede those who have fallen asleep.<br><br>
				For the Lord himself, with a word of command, with the<br>
				voice of an archangel and with the trumpet of God,<br>
				will come down from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first.<br><br>
				Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them <br>
				in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.<br><br>
				Thus we shall always be with the Lord. <br>
				Therefore, console one another with these words.

				We know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus<br>

				in his presence.<br><br>
				Everything indeed is for you, <br>
				so that the grace bestowed in abundance on more and more people may cause the thanksgiving to

				for the glory of God. <br><br>
				Therefore, we are not discouraged;<br>
				rather, although our outer self is wasting away, <br>
				our inner self is being renewed day by day. <br><br>
				For this momentary light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all
				comparison,<br>
				as we look not to what is seen but to what is unseen; <br>
				for what is seen is transitory, but what is unseen is eternal. <br><br>
				For we know that if our earthly dwelling, a tent, <br>

				A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Romans

				If God is for us, who can be against us? <br><br>
				He did not spare
				his own Son but handed him over for us all, <br>
				how will he not also give us everything else along with him?<br><br>
				Who will bring a charge against God's chosen ones?<br>
				It is God who acquits us. Who will condemn? <br>
				It is Christ Jesus who died, rather, was raised, who also is
				at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us. <br><br>
				What will separate us from the love of Christ? <br>
				Will anguish, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or
				nakedness, or peril, or the sword?<br><br>
				No, in all these things we conquer overwhelmingly
				through him who loved us. <br><br>
				For I am convinced that neither death, <br>nor life, nor angels,
				nor principalities, <br> nor present things, nor
				future things, <br> nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any
				other creature <br>will be able to separate us from the love of

				Hope does not disappoint,<br>

				For Christ, while we were still helpless, <br>yet died at the

				Indeed, only with difficulty does one die for a just person,<br>
				though perhaps for a good person one might even find
				courage to die.<br><br>
				But God proves his love for us in that while we were still
				sinners Christ died for us.<br><br>
				How much more then, since we are now justified by his
				blood, <br>will we be saved through him from the wrath.<br><br>
				Indeed, if, while we were enemies,<br> we were reconciled to
				God through the death of his Son,
				how much more, once reconciled,
				will we be saved by his life.<br><br>
				Not only that, but we also boast of God through our

				Are you unaware that we who were baptized into Christ

				We were indeed buried with him through baptism into

				by the glory of the Father, we too might live in newness of life.<br><br>
				For if we have grown into union with him through a death like his,

				We know that our old self was crucified with him, so that
				our sinful body might be done away with, that we might
				no longer be in slavery to sin.
				For a dead person has been absolved from sin. <br><br>
				If, then, we have died with Christ, we believe that we
				shall also live with him. We know that Christ, raised from
				the dead, dies no more; death no longer has power over him.
